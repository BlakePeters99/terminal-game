// event: A wild snorlax 
// dialog scenario: A wild snorlax appears on your adventure, blocking the entrance path to the mystical shop.
// choice 1 Poke him with your weapon
// reaction 1: (dwarf) pokes him with his mighty sword but all the snorlax sees is a tiny dude 
//      with a toothpick stabbing him and rolls on top of you going back to sleep
// result: you died.
// reaction 2: (elf & human) stab the snorlax and it immediately wakes up and moves out of the way
// result: you progress with no money
// choice 2: Tell him a funny joke
// reaction 1: (dwarf): Hey Snorlax! You can always rely on a dwarf, we'll never look down on you.
// reaction 2: (elf): 3 elves walk in a bar. One starts to hug the wooden interior, 
//      "one stands high up on the bar and the last one stands in the darkest corner and glares..."" 
//      "The other guest es look at them and then at the dwarven Barkeeper and ask:"You not gonna stop them?" "
//      "The Barkeeper just shrugs and says:"Nah, don't bother."
//      "If they leave they might come back and bring a blood elf and no one wants to see THAT!".
// reaction 3: (human): A high elf, a wood elf, and a dark elf walked into a bar, BANG! A dwarf walked under it.
// result (for 1-3): Snorlax jolts up laughing and hands you a gold rock as tip for that wonderful joke. 
// choice 3: Squeeze past him
// reaction 1: (dwarf) As a dwarf, you narrowly slip past the snorlax when they exhale, successfully making it to the shop.
// result: you progress with no money
// reaction 2: (elf and human) You try to push yourself past the snorlax but then it suddenly 
//      inhales for a massive yawn squishing you between the rock and its massive belly. 
// result: you died

// result: you live but at what cost?
